                <div class="letter">
                    <p class="r-body-1 charcoal">With a career spanning over two decades in staffing and consulting, I evaluated and provided
                        talented workers to some of the largest companies in the world. <br>

                        Much to the chagrin of my previous managers, it wasn't about the quick buck or the commission
                        for me. My main focus was building long-term relationships. I wanted to work with like-minded
                        professionals to help them solve their most complex problems. My theory was if you had strong
                        relationships, business would follow. I was right that business would follow. But I was still
                        focusing on placing individuals onto teams hoping they would fit in with the team after they
                        were placed. <br>

                        Clients and colleagues all faced the same issue - where can they build and/or find a
                        top-performing team to solve their problems? The staffing, consulting and managed services are
                        billion dollar industries that profit by providing talent to work at companies. The focus has
                        always been on the individual worker to fill a vacant role on a team, not taking into
                        consideration if he/she would be a good addition to the team. Consulting and managed services
                        companies try to focus on teams, but still place individuals onto teams, hoping for the best
                        outcome where the team works well together. These created teams often resort to the 80/20 rule,
                        where 20 percent of the team do all of the work and carry the weight of the entire team, which
                        ultimately does not solve the problem of hiring a top-performing team. <br>

                        TeamBond set out to solve this problem and change how companies hire talent and more
                        importantly, where they can hire teams. <br>

                        Good teamwork is essential in all organizations. It isn't a secret that the best performing
                        teams work well together and have a synergy - where the combined effect of the team is greater
                        than the sum of the individual efforts. Organizations are much more likely to perform well when
                        their people work effectively as a team. TeamBond solves the problem of who is right for the
                        team by considering behavioral science in addition to a worker's skills, education and
                        experience. TeamBond is revolutionizing the staffing and recruitment process, making it easier
                        and quicker for companies to build teams. <br>

                        TeamBond will also bring the best jobs to workers. Only jobs on teams that a worker is a fit for
                        will be recommended to the worker, thus streamlining and changing how you find your next role.
                        <br>

                        We invite you to experience TeamBond, an online platform that creates Teams by Design. </p>
